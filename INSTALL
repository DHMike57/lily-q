Based on my fresh install of vanilla Debian, hopefully you should only need to install a couple of things.

LUA 5.3
Most of LilyQuick is written in Lua 5.3. I have almost always found Lua easy to install. First download Lua from here:

https://www.lua.org/ftp/

In a terminal, navigate to the uncompressed folder. Type

> sudo make linux

then:

> sudo make install

My Debian installation needed libreadline-dev to install Lua. If this is missing, type:

> sudo apt-get libreadline-dev

Then make and make install. More information at http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/readme.html

ALSA
You probably have Alsa installed, but you need the development library:

> sudo apt-get libasound2-dev

COMPILING
Then (unless I’ve forgotten something), in a terminal, navigate to the directory this file is in. Type:

> make

Hopefully GCC is installed. If it isn’t,

> sudo install gcc

should work.

RUNNING
Type

> sudo ./lq

to run LilyQuick (intercepting keystrokes requires superuser privileges).


COMPUTER KEYBOARD
If compilation was successful, you should have an executable file called lq in this directory.
Now open the file LQconfig.lua for editing. For LilyQuick to find your computer keyboard you need to give it a file name. In Debian, it can be found in a directory called /dev/input/by-id. Here’s what I see.

> cd /dev/input/by-id
/dev/input/by-id$ ls

usb-Apple__Inc_Apple_Keyboard-event-if01
usb-Apple__Inc_Apple_Keyboard-event-kbd
usb-Logitech_USB-PS_2_Optical_Mouse-event-mouse
usb-Logitech_USB-PS_2_Optical_Mouse-mouse

From this I can put:
deviceName = "/dev/input/by-id/usb-Apple__Inc_Apple_Keyboard-event-kbd"

into LQconfig.lua.

MIDI KEYBOARD
LilyQuick will attempt to connect to your MIDI keyboard. It just needs to be able to identify it uniquely. In the terminal type:

> amidi -l
Dir Device    Name
I   hw:2,0,0  KeyStudio MIDI 1

The device ID can potentially change, so LilyQuick works out the device ID from the name. So my LQconfig.lua file says:

MIDIKeyboardName = "KeyStudio MIDI"

RUNNING QSYNTH OR FLUIDSYNTH
For convenience, LilyQuick will attempt to start a synthesizer when it starts, then connect to it. The file Linux.lua does a couple of Linux-specific things, and defines the command that LilyQuick will use to run the synthesizer. For best results, replace vaughan with your username in this line:

local OpenSynthCommand = [[su -c "qsynth &" vaughan]]

to run Qsynth as yourself rather than as root. Of course, you may wish to run Fluidsynth directly.

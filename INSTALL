Based on my fresh install of vanilla Debian, hopefully you should only need to install a couple of things. 

LUA 5.3
Most of LilyQuick is written in Lua 5.3. It includes Lua 5.3.4 statically to avoid versioning problems. My Debian installation needed libreadline-dev to install Lua. If this is missing, type:

> sudo apt-get libreadline-dev

Then make and make install. More information at http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/readme.html

ALSA
You probably have Alsa installed, but you need the development library:

> sudo apt-get libasound2-dev

COMPILING
Then (unless I’ve forgotten something), in a terminal, navigate to the directory this file is in. Type:

> make

The make install script adds an alias to LilyQuick for your convenience. The alias includes sudo which is why it asks for your password. Sudo is necessary as intercepting keystrokes requires superuser privileges.

> make install

Make may fail if GCC is not installed:

> sudo install gcc

should fix this.

RUNNING
Open a new terminal window (as the new alias won’t be picked up by your current window) and type:

> lq

to run LilyQuick (and type your password for sudo which is in the alias).

COMPUTER KEYBOARD
If compilation was successful, you should have an executable file called lq in this directory.
Now open the file LQconfig.lua for editing. For LilyQuick to find your computer keyboard you need to give it a file name. In Debian, it can be found in a directory called /dev/input/by-id. Here’s what I see.

> cd /dev/input/by-id
/dev/input/by-id$ ls

usb-Apple__Inc_Apple_Keyboard-event-if01
usb-Apple__Inc_Apple_Keyboard-event-kbd
usb-Logitech_USB-PS_2_Optical_Mouse-event-mouse
usb-Logitech_USB-PS_2_Optical_Mouse-mouse

From this I can put:
deviceName = "/dev/input/by-id/usb-Apple__Inc_Apple_Keyboard-event-kbd"

into LQconfig.lua.

MIDI KEYBOARD
LilyQuick will attempt to connect to your MIDI keyboard. It just needs to be able to identify it uniquely. In the terminal type:

> amidi -l
Dir Device    Name
I   hw:2,0,0  KeyStudio MIDI 1

The device ID can potentially change, so LilyQuick works out the device ID from the name. So my LQconfig.lua file says:

MIDIKeyboardName = "KeyStudio MIDI"

RUNNING QSYNTH OR FLUIDSYNTH
For convenience, LilyQuick will attempt to start a synthesizer when it starts, then connect to it. The file Linux.lua does a couple of Linux-specific things, and defines the command that LilyQuick will use to run the synthesizer. Replace yourusername with your username in this line:

local OpenSynthCommand = [[su -c "qsynth --midi-driver=alsa_seq &" yourusername]]

to run Qsynth as yourself rather than as root. Of course, you may wish to run Fluidsynth directly. LilyQuick needs Qsynth to use the alsa_seq MIDI driver. Unfortunately when you open Qsynth this way, the MIDI driver will remain on alsa_seq. If you normally use a different driver, in the Gnome desktop environment you can edit the file:

/usr/share/applications/qsynth.desktop

> sudo nano /usr/share/applications/qsynth.desktop

Change the Exec= line to

Exec=/usr/bin/qsynth --midi-driver=oss

or whichever MIDI driver you normally use. Then when you open Qsynth with the GUI, it will use the correct MIDI driver.
